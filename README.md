# Introduction

I was the content producer for [Luke Barousse's SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql), where the goal was to teach anyone SQL, no previous coding experience required. 

# The Queries

The queries included in this section are for two main parts of the video:
1. Advanced Section
2. Portfolio Project

The basics section queries are not included here. 

## Advanced Section

These are the the main queries in the advanced section. View there here: [advanced_sql_folder](/advanced_sql/). 

The advanced section focused on:
- How to Run a Database in PostgreSQL
- Data Types
- Manipulate Tables
- Handling Dates
- Case Expression
- Subqueries and CTEs
- UNION Operators

##  Portfolio Project

These queries are for the portfolio project. View them here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/).

The goal of the project was to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively. And to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills and find optimal jobs.

The questions to answer were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
W5. hat are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
Below are the technical tools I used for this course. 

- **SQL**: The backbone of the course, which lets me query the database. 
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: For database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and sharing my SQL scripts..
